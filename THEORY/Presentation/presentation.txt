Source of Bio energy:
Wood and wood processing wastes—firewood, wood pellets, 
and wood chips, lumber and furniture mill sawdust and waste,
and black liquor from pulp 
and paper mills.

Agricultural crops and waste materials—corn, soybeans, 
sugar cane, switchgrass, woody plants, and algae, and crop
 and food processing residues.

Biogenic materials in municipal solid waste—paper, cotton, 
and wool products, and food, yard, and wood wastes.

Animal manure and human sewage

Landfill gas (LFG) is a natural byproduct of the 
decomposition 
of organic material in landfills
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some of the advantages of biomass energy are:

1. Biomass is always and widely available as a renewable 
source of energy.
The organic materials used to produce biomass are infinite,
 since our society consistently produces waste such as 
garbage, wood and manure.

2.  It is carbon neutral.
As a natural part of photosynthesis, biomass fuels only 
release the same amount of 
carbon into the atmosphere as was absorbed by plants in 
the course of their life cycle.

3. It reduces the overreliance of fossil fuels.

Not only is there is a limited supply of fossil fuels, 
but fossil fuels come with environmental baggage, including 
the release of large amounts of carbon dioxide into the 
atmosphere and the pollutants that result from removal, 
transportation and production.

4. Is less expensive than fossil fuels. 

While fossil fuel production requires a heavy outlay of
capital,
such as oil drills, gas pipelines and fuel collection,
biomass technology is much cheaper. Manufacturers and
producers are able to generate higher profits from a 
lower output.

5. Biomass production adds a revenue source for 
manufacturers.
Producers of waste can add value by channeling their 
garbage to create a more 
profitable use in the form biomass energy.

6.Less garbage in landfills. 
By burning solid waste, the amount of garbage dumped in 
landfills is 
reduced by 60 to 90 percent, and reduces the cost of landfill
 disposal and 
amount of land required for landfill.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Biomass energy is not as efficient as fossil fuels 
Some biofuels, like Ethanol, is relatively inefficient 
as compared to gasoline. In fact, it has to be fortified with 
fossil fuels to 
increase its efficiency.

2. It is not entirely clean
While biomass is carbon neutral, the use of animal 
and human waste escalates the amount of methane gases, 
which are also 
damaging to the environment. Additionally, the pollution 
created from burning wood 
and other natural materials can be considered just as bad as 
that resulting from burning 
coal and other types of energy resources.

3. It can lead to deforestation.

Since wood is one of the most used source of biomass energy, 
vast amounts of wood and
 other waste products have to be burned to produce the desired 
amount of power. While currently
 there is enough wood waste already, there is a risk of 
deforestation in the future.

4.Biomass plants require a lot of space.
While it’s difficult to find a plant that is in a convenient 
place in an urban area, 
utilizing onsite hardware like the BioMax® technology, companies

can create biomass energy at a fraction of the space of a large
 facility.

Mainly is a chemical process for trans-esterification of the
complex triglyceride molecule of vegetable oil.

biggest disadvantage of biodiesel is its higher 
cost than SVO
